# Browser Controlled Robot
======

Have you seen projects where a robot or a device is controlled by a phone, tablet, or computer over the internet? 
[The BrowserBot](http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/projects/browserbot/) allows you to do just that, very quickly and easily. The browser bot is a simple example project where you control a robot through your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop.

## How It Works
------
The example uses websockets to pass messages back and forth between your browser and your robot. Data is sent from the web page when you press the graphic buttons on the web page.  You can also control the robot with Keyboard strokes.  The RPi_Server_Code runs on python using tornado.
