# This code is an example for running a motor to a target position set by the encoder of another motor.
# 
# Hardware: Connect EV3 or NXT motors to the BrickPi3 motor ports B and C. Make sure that the BrickPi3 is running on a 9v power supply.
#
# Results:  When you run this program, motor C speed will be controlled by the position of motor B. Manually rotate motor B, and motor C's speed will change.

        #     The first item in the list is the value (what we want to use to control motor C's speed).
