To update the BrickPi3 Firmware
-------------------------------
Connect the BrickPi3 to a Raspberry Pi. Assuming you've set up the BrickPi3 software by running DI Update on Raspbian for Robots (or the install.sh script on Raspbian), everything should be ready for you to update the firmware.

Run the firmware update script:

    sudo bash /home/pi/Dexter/BrickPi3/Firmware/brickpi3samd_flash_firmware.sh

Towards the bottom of the output (third line from the end), you should see ** Verified OK ** which means the firmware was flashed and verified successfully.

You can run the example program "Read_Info.py" in "BrickPi3/Software/Python/Examples" to make sure that the FW version is correct (version "1.1.0" as of writing this).
